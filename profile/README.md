# Decentralized Real Estate Rental dApp

A Microservices-Based, Blockchain-Powered Real Estate Rental Platform  
Built with **Ethereum, Spring Boot, Angular, and DevOps Best Practices**

---

## Overview

This project presents a decentralized application (dApp) designed for **peer-to-peer real estate rentals**. By leveraging **Ethereum blockchain**, users can list, lease, and manage rental properties **without intermediaries**, ensuring transparent, secure, and trustless transactions.

The system adopts a **microservices architecture** powered by:

- **Spring Boot** for backend RESTful services  
- **Angular** for the frontend user interface  
- **Hardhat + Solidity** for blockchain smart contracts  
- **AWS + Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning  
- **Docker + Kubernetes** for container orchestration  
- **CI/CD with GitHub & Jenkins**, monitoring with **Prometheus + Grafana**
