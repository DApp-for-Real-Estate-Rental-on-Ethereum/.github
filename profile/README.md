## dApp

Decentralized Real Estate Rental dApp: A Microservices-Based Platform Integrating Web3, Spring
Boot, Angular, and DevOps Practices.
This project proposes the development of a decentralized application (dApp) specialized in real
estate rentals, enabling peer-to-peer property listings and leasing on the Ethereum blockchain for
secure, transparent, and intermediary-free transactions. The application will utilize a microservices
architecture with Spring Boot for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and Hardhat for smart
contract development. To ensure scalability, reliability, and efficient deployment, the project
incorporates DevOps practices including CI/CD pipelines with GitHub and Jenkins, infrastructure
as code (IaC) with Terraform on AWS, containerization with Docker, orchestration with Kubernetes,
and monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
The project will be executed by a team of 5 student engineers: Backend Engineer, Frontend
Engineer, Cloud Engineer, DevOps Engineer, and Blockchain/Smart Contract Engineer. This
collaborative effort aims to demonstrate the integration of modern web development, blockchain
technology, and cloud-native practices in the real estate sector
